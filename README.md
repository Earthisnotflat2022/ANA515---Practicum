Practicum Assignment for ANA515 SU22


Instructions for all projects:  
**Using R, you need to clean the data so it is ready for analysis. You may find errors in formatting, spelling, missing values, data type, outliers, etc. You can decide how to handle the errors, but you should be able to justify your methods. (30 Points) 

**If there is more than one datafile, you need to combine the two files into one datafile. (5 points) 

**You should include visuals (histogram, boxplot, graphs, â€¦) for at least 2 variables. (10 points) 

**Your code must include comments to describe what is being done. When dealing with missing data, outliers and errors, make sure you justify why you handled them the way that you did. You can write this in your #comments in the code. (15 points)
